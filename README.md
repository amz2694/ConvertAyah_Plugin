# Joplin Convert Ayah Plugin

## How to use

![gif example](convert.gif)

You can get a certain ayah by entering a sura's name and ayah's number with a colon in-between.
Example => فاتحه:2

You can also get a range of ayah by using a hyphen between two ayah numbers.
Example => بقره:2-5

After selecting a line in the text, you can hold `Ctrl+Shift+Q` to get the corresponding ayah. If no line is selected, the last line will be converted. Any combination of keys can be set as a shortcut in the "options" menu.
